-----------

1. Make a virtual environment using pip or conda, whatever you're comfortable.
2. Explore the bilby documentation page and run a four-parameter CBC tutorial in your local machine using the environment you created earlier.
3. You could try different cases of masses.
4. Also, think about the priors you have used.
5. Sample over m1, m2, a1, a2.
6. Is there a way to marginalize extrinsic parameters like luminosity distance, coalescence phase, and time? This helps reduce sampling time.
7. Your final posterior plot (corner) over those four parameters should display true values, too, i.e., injection values.
8. Note down sampling times with luminosity distance marginalized and without such marginalization.
